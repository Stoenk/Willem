<h2><a name="early"></a>Early Life</h2>
<p>
  Dafoe was born in Appleton, Wisconsin.[2][3] One of eight children of Muriel Isabel (née Sprissler) and Dr. William Alfred Dafoe (1917-2014),[4][5] he recalled in 2009: "My five sisters raised me because my father was a surgeon, my mother was a nurse and they worked together, so I didn't see either of them much."[6] He has German, English, Irish, Scottish, and French ancestry.[7] In high school, he acquired the nickname Willem, which coincidentally happens to be the Dutch version of the name William.[8]
</p>

<p>
Dafoe studied drama at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, but left after a year and a half to join the experimental theater company Theatre X in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before moving to New York in 1976.[8] There he apprenticed under Richard Schechner, director of the avant-garde theater troupe The Performance Group, where he met and became romantically involved with Elizabeth LeCompte. She, with her former romantic partner Spalding Gray and others, edged out Schechner and created the Wooster Group.[8] Within a year Dafoe was part of the company.[9]
